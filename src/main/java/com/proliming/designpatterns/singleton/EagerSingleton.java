/**
 * <p>In eager initialization, the instance of <em>Singleton</em> Class is
 * created at the time of class loading, this is the easiest method to create
 * a singleton class but it has a drawback that instance is created even though
 * client application might not be using it.
 * <p>If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach
 * to use. But in most of the scenarios, <em>Singleton</em> classes are created
 * for resources such as <b>File System</b>,<b>Datebase connections</b>etc and we
 * should avoid the instantiation until unless client calls the <code>getInstance</code>.
 * Also this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
