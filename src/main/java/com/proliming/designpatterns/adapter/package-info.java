/**
 * <p/>
 * Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern
 * and its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together.
 * The object that joins these unrelated interface is called an Adapter.
 * As a real life example, we can think of a mobile charger as an
 * adapter because mobile battery needs 3 volts to charge but the
 * normal socket produces either 120V (US) or 240V (India).
 * So the mobile charger works as an adapter between mobile charging
 * socket and the wall socket.
